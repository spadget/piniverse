Do not use production workflows for staging tests.

## Safety rules

- Check which repository is open before editing or pushing.
- Never commit passwords, private keys or Supabase service-role keys.
- Review changes carefully before pushing to `main`.
- Keep production-specific files separate from staging-specific files.
